# Vegetable Recognition using CNN

## Overview
"Vegetable Recognition using CNN" is a project that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images of vegetables. It encompasses the full pipeline from data preprocessing and model building to training, validation, and testing.

## Features
- Data preprocessing steps including resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- An optimized CNN architecture for efficient vegetable recognition.
- Training and validation setup with detailed performance metrics.
- Testing framework to evaluate the model's real-world performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of various images of vegetables, categorized into multiple classes. Each class represents a type of vegetable, such as carrots, tomatoes, and broccoli, among others. The dataset is split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. This division helps in training the model effectively, validating its performance during the training process, and finally testing its ability to classify new, unseen images accurately.

### Dataset Structure
- Training Set: Contains a significant portion of the images for training the CNN model.
- Validation Set: Used to tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
- Testing Set: Evaluates the model's performance and generalization capability on unseen data.
